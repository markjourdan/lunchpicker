<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>Ever been trying to decide where to go to lunch, well we make that decision easy with the lunch picker in this application where we will pick today's destination</p>
<h1>What to Expect</h1>
<p>A lunch enthusiast will be able to setup a Clique for their group of lunch buddies. This group will all be invited to suggest lunch destinations and the Clique Master will then approve the lunch spot. Once everything has been setup each lunch buddy will
 be able to rate there favorite and least favorite destinations. Each Clique member will get an email right around the defined lunch hour with today's destination. After lunch is complete a follow up email will hit your group with ratings from your lunch crew.
 Which over time the system will become smarter and make better decisions on where you should eat today!</p>
